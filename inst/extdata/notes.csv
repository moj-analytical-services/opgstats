[Note 2],"Data is provided for all PoAs applied and registered, regardless of the home location of the donor. The accompanying csv 'CSV OPG Powers of Attorney by country, region and Local Authority YYYY QQ' provides breakdowns by donor home location (by country, region and local authority). The current LPA rules set out that anoyone can make an LPA irrespective of where they live as long as they have assets in England/Wales."
[Note 3],"An Enduring Power of Attorney allows the person creating it to nominate someone they trust (often a spouse or close family member) to manage their finances, should they themselves lose the mental capacity to do so in the future."
[Note 4],"A Lasting Powers of Attorney allows the person creating it (the Donor) to nominate someone now (the Attorney) that they trust to make decisions on their behalf about things such as property, affairs or personal welfare at a time in the future when they no longer wish to make those decisions or they may lack the mental capacity to make those decisions themselves."
[Note 5],There are two types of LPAs (Property & Finance and Health & Wellbeing) and one type of EPA (Property & Finance). Further details on these subtypes can be found in the accompanying guide.
[Note 6],"Gender is inferred from the donor's title. Cases within the 'other' category relate to titles which cannot clearly be categorised as male or female (i.e. Dr, Professor etc), and where titles have additional characters/errors (i.e. Mrs., Mr' etc).  Possible non-binary also appear in this category as it is unclear if these are non-binary titles or mistakes in spelling of a male/female title (i.e. Mx.)"
